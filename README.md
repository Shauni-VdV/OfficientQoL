# OfficientQoL
Quality of Life addition for Officient.io

# Features
## Team calendar
* Current day column marked in a different color
* Ability to click on header to mark the column, and move the people with no entries to the top

# Install
## Tampermonkey
Find the script [here](/dist/officient_qol.js).
The script assumes that you use [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and has the appropriate header so you can simply copy and paste the script as a new Tampermonkey script with no additional changes.

## Other
If you use another browser extension to inject JavaScript, should remove the Tampermonkey header lines from the script before injecting.
